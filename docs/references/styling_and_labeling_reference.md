## Styling Specific Items
Data Sets, Functions, and Curve Fits can all be individually styled.  You can modify the styles all at once in the **Styles** menu, or you can modify them individually in their respective menus.  The following example shows the two locations that you could modify the style of Data Set 2:

<div class="centered"><img src="../../img/styling_and_labeling_reference/weapon_of_choice.png"></div>

## Graph Themes
Graph themes are used to change the overall style of the graph, which can be accessed through the **Styles** menu.  The currently built-in themes we have are shown below:

<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Theme Name</th><th>Preview</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Standard</td><td><img src="../../img/styling_and_labeling_reference/standard_theme.png"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Minimal</td><td><img src="../../img/styling_and_labeling_reference/minimal_theme.png"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Dark</td><td><img src="../../img/styling_and_labeling_reference/dark_theme.png"></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Blueprint</td><td><img src="../../img/styling_and_labeling_reference/blueprint_theme.png"></td></tr>
