!!! danger "Yob Has Been Taken off G Suite Marketplace"
    As of 7/18/2021, Yob can no longer be installed. Google changed their policies regarding Yob's use of the user's
    Google Drive account to store graph data, which would potentially subject us to $75,000+ in 3rd-party security auditing
    fees.  Due to this financial threat, we made the difficult choice to remove Yob from G Suite Marketplace entirely. We greatly
    apologize for the inconvenience.

## Overview
Yob was a **fast** and **simple** graphing tool that was geared towards performing graphical analysis within Google Docs.

### Simple but powerful
Making graphs in Yob was quick and easy, making it a great choice for users who just want to plot some data and stick the graph in a document.  However, Yob also came with many advanced features such as **calculated columns** and **non-linear curve fitting**, making it a useful tool for more advanced users.

### Convenient
Yob used to run entirely within a Google Doc, so you never had to worry about transferring graphs between your computer and the document.  In fact, Yob [blurred the lines](./references/storage_and_loading_reference.md) between graph files and your document entirely.
