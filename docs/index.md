## Overview
Yob is a **fast** and **simple** graphing tool that's geared towards performing graphical analysis within Google Docs.

### Simple but powerful
Making graphs in Yob is quick and easy, making it a great choice for users who just want to plot some data and stick the graph in a document, but Yob also comes with many advanced features such as **calculated columns** and **non-linear curve fitting**, making it a useful tool for more advanced users as well.

### Convenient
Yob runs entirely within a Google Doc, so you never have to worry about transferring graphs between your computer and the document.  In fact, Yob **blurs the lines** between graph files and your document entirely.
