# About
Yob was a project started by **Tanner Nielsen** and **Jordan Hendrickson** in the spring of 2014, motivated by our appreciation for the teacher of our high school physics class, as well as the dislike for the graphing software he had us use.

## Development
Originally, we were developing in Java and our plans for the software were much more ambitious.  We weren't experienced developers, but we managed to hack together an account system and beginnings of an assignment editor by the end of the summer.  The old login screen looked like this:

To our surprise, the school decided to replace all of the lab laptops with Chromebooks when fall came around, which Java applications were not easily compatible with.  Moreover, all of the teachers had started using Google Classroom, which made our software largely irrelevant.

This was a huge setback for us, and we nearly gave up, but we decided to start over and use JavaScript, an entirely new language to us at the time.  We also chose to scale back and focus on making a graphing application to complement, rather than replace Google Docs and Google Classroom.  This decision and two years of development got the project to where it is today.

## Acknowledgements
We owe a great debt of gratitude to **Mr. Dean Roush**, the Physics teacher at Luck High School, for helping us test and shape the software.  This project would have never gotten off the ground without his patience and trust, would have never progressed so far without his willingness to test our software as it developed.
