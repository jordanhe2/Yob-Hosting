# About
Yob was a project started by **Tanner Nielsen** and **Jordan Hendrickson** in the summer of 2013, motivated by our appreciation for the teacher of our high school physics class, as well as the dislike for the graphing software he had us use.

## Development
Originally, we were working in Java and our plans for the software were much more ambitious.  We weren't experienced developers, but we managed to hack together an account system and beginnings of an assignment editor by the end of the summer.  The old login screen looked like this:

<div class="centered"><img src="../../img/original_yob.png"></div>

However, our school decided to replace all the lab laptops with Chromebooks, which a Java application would not be easily compatible with.  Moreover, all the teachers began using Google Classroom, which largely made our software irrelevant.
