## Browser Support
Yob, being new software, has yet to go through extensive testing on different browsers.  Currently, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) is our only officially supported browser.  Yob will still work for the most part in other browsers, but we **cannot guarantee** that it will be fully functional.  If we gain enough users, we will expand our offical support to other browsers such as Firefox.

## Known Issues
* **Some business and school accounts may have security restrictions that prevent you from inserting graphs into the document.**  This is our top priority issue, but until we get is resolved, you can right click on the graph preview, click "Save as image", then manually upload the graph to your document.
* Zooming in to extremely small viewing windows may crash your browser
* At certain graph sizes, Functions and Curve Fits may render incorrectly:  it will look as though another function is passing through it and the area between is filled.
* Loading Curve Fits from a saved graph will automatically make models custom.
* Graphs will occasionally load the wrong window if auto zoom is enabled.
