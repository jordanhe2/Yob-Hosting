## Browser Support
Yob, being new software, has yet to go through extensive testing on different browsers.  Currently, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/) is our only officially supported browser.  Yob will still work for the most part in other browsers, but we **cannot guarantee** that it will be fully functional.  If we gain enough users, we will expand our offical support to other browsers such as FireFox.

## Known Issues
* Zooming in to extremely small viewing windows may crash your browser
* At certain graph sizes, Functions and Curve Fits may render incorrectly:  it will look as though another function is passing through it and the area between is filled.
* Loading Curve Fits from a saved graph will automatically make models custom.
* Graphs will occasionally load the wrong window if auto zoom is enabled.
