# Privacy Policy
Last updated: June 09, 2021

Please read this Privacy Policy ("Policy", "Agreement") carefully before using the Yob Google Doc Add-on (the "Service", "Software") operated by The Yob Team ("us", "we", or "our").

## Information Collection and Use
We use Google Analytics strictly to inform and guide future decisions for the Service. We do not use Google Analytics to track, collect or upload any data that personally identifies an individual (such as a name, email address or billing information). We never collect any personal data or user-generated content (i.e., graphs) via Google Analytics.

## User Data Management
We _do not_ store any individual's graph data on our own servers (nor do we have any servers). All graph data is strictly kept within the user's own Google account.  For detailed information about how this data is managed, see the [Storing and Loading Reference](/references/storage_and_loading_reference/).
