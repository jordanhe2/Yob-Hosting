If you don\u2019t have Yob installed already, visit our \nGoogle Doc add-on store page\n.\n\n\nTo start Yob, open a Google Doc and select \nAdd-ons\n > \nYob\n > \nOpen Editor\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Home Screen\n\n\nWhen you open the graph editor, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe home screen is organized into two sections:  the graph preview, and the main menu. The graph preview can be moved by clicking and dragging, and zoomed by scrolling the mouse wheel. The main menu contains several submenus for managing specific parts of your graph.  Let\u2019s start with the Data Set menu.\n\n\nPlotting Data\n\n\nClick \u201cData Sets\u201d from the main menu, then click the + icon to create a new Data Set. Locate the table editor at the bottom of the menu.  Here, we can enter the time-distance data from our ball experiment. Here is some sample data that we have supplied for you (you may simply copy and paste this data):\n\n\n\n    \nTime (s)\nDistance (m)\n\n    \n1.0\n1.5\n\n    \n1.5\n1.8\n\n    \n2.0\n2.3\n\n    \n2.5\n2.6\n\n    \n3.0\n3.5\n\n    \n3.5\n3.7\n\n    \n4.0\n4.2\n\n    \n4.5\n4.9\n\n    \n5.0\n5.3\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce entered into the table, the data can be viewed in the graph preview.  To automatically fit the window to show all of the data, select the \nAuto Zoom\n checkbox.\n\n\nNext, let\u2019s put proper labels on our Data Set.  We will set the xLabel field to \nTime\n and the xUnit field to \ns\n for seconds, then the yLabel field to \nDistance\n and the yUnit field to \nm\n for meters.\n\n\nYour graph should now look something like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the Projected Distance\n\n\nNow that we have plotted the data, we can find the projected distance of the ball as time goes on. To accomplish this, we want to create a Curve Fit, which will calculate the line of best fit, given a Data Set and a model.\n\n\nClick \u201cBack\u201d to return to the main menu.  Then click the Curve Fits submenu, and click the + icon to create a new Curve Fit.\n\n\nSet the data source of the new Curve Fit to the Data Set we previously created:  Data Set 1. Then change the model type from none to linear. Viola! You should now see the line of best fit for this data on the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the Finishing Touches\n\n\nTo introduce a little more color on this graph, let\u2019s change the style of the Curve Fit line.  To accomplish this, click on the line preview icon near the top of the menu.  You will be presented with several styling options.  Let\u2019s change the color blue and make the line dashed, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what\u2019s a graph without a title?  A title can be added to the graph back in the Labels submenu.  At the top of the menu, enter \u201cDistance vs Time\u201d in the Title field.  When you're done, you should have something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nInserting the Graph\n\n\nNow that our graph is complete, we can send it to the document. To do this, simply click \u201cInsert\u201d at the top of Yob, then select the size of the graph you want to insert. After the graph is added, you may notice that it has a link attached to it. \nDo not remove this link.\n This link is how Yob knows where the graph data is stored on your Google Drive account, so that you may edit the graph later if you wish.\n\n\nIf you would like to learn more about how Yob stores graph data, view \nthe data storage reference\n where we explain this in greater detail.\n\n\nCheck Out the Other Tutorials\n\n\nYob is full of great features that are covered throughout our tutorial series.

This page is meant to serve as a reference for using expressions throughout the program.  If you are new to using expressions, you may want to check out one of the following tutorials first:\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Curve Fits\n\n\nAdvanced Data Sets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Rules\n\n\n\n\nAll expressions should follow the general syntax of mathematics.  Order of operations applies.\n\n\nAll operators need to be explicit.  For example, you cannot write \n2x\n; you would have to write \n2*x\n instead.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Tell When an Expression is Valid\n\n\nIn all of the places that you can edit expressions within Yob, the text field will let you know when your expression is invalid by turning its border red:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferencing Other Items\n\n\nA part of what makes expressions so effective is their ability to refer to other items.  Accomplishing this is simple:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reference a \nFunction\n, simply use its name as you would when using sin(x) or abs(x).  For example, \nf1(x + 2) + f2(x - 2)\n would be a valid way to reference Functions in an expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reference a \nCurve Fit\n, the same principle applies but names are denoted with \"cf\" rather than \"f\".  For example, \ncf1(x / 3) + sin(x)\n would be a valid way to reference a Curve Fit in an expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reference a \nData Set Column\n, use the Data Set name along with the column name.  For example, \nd1c2\n would reference the \nsecond\n column of the \nfirst\n Data Set.  However, only Calculated Column expression are allowed to reference Data Set Columns.  This is demonstrated in the \nAdvanced Data Sets\n tutorial and explained in greater detail in the \nCalculated Columns Reference\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining Referential Integrity\n\n\nAllowing users to put references in their expressions gives them a lot of freedom, but doing to makes it necessary to impose a few restrictions to maintain referential integrity.

Another benefit of Calculated Columns is that they are updated dynamically, so you can make changes on the fly without having to manually recalculate anything.\nEach column of a Data Set has a calculated column menu that can be opened by clicking on the calculator icon in the top right of the column header.\n\n\nThe Calculated Column menu contains 3 items:\n\n\n\n\nThe expression field\n\n\nThe data selector\n\n\nThe enabled checkbox\n\n\n\n\nThe Expression Field\n\n\nThe expression field is what is used to generate the values of the column.  An example would be be \nd1c1 + 2*d2c1\n, which would make each value of the column be the sum of the cooresponding value in the first column of the first Data Set and twice the cooresponding value of the first column of the second Data Set.  You can also reference Functions or Curve Fits in your expressions.  For example, \nf3(d1c1) / 10\n would make each value of the column be 1/10th of the first column of the first Data Set run through the third function.  One thing to watch out for, however, is circular dependencies.  For example, you can't have d1c1 use d2c1 in its expression if d2c1 uses d3c1 and d3c1 uses d1c1, because of the circular dependencies. [more on this]\n\n\nThe Data Type Selector\n\n\nThe data selector provides an easy way to figure out which item it is that you want to use in your Calculated Column expression.  For example, if you wanted to use the Distance column from a Distance vs Time Data Set but didn't know its number, you could simply select it from the list then click \"Insert\", which will insert the proper text... [more on this]\n\n\nThe Enabled Checkbox\n\n\nThe enabled checkbox sets whether or not the Column should generate (or calculate) its values from the expression.\nCalculated Columns cells appear yellow and cannot be modified within the table editor like regular Columns can.",

We weren't experienced developers, but we managed to hack together an account system and beginnings of an assignment editor by the end of the summer.  The old login screen looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo our surprise, the school decided to replace all of the lab laptops with Chromebooks when fall came around, which Java applications were not easily compatible with.  Moreover, all of the teachers had started using Google Classroom, which made our software largely irrelevant.\n\n\nThis was a huge setback for us, and we nearly gave up, but we decided to start over and use JavaScript, an entirely new language to us at the time.  We also chose to scale back and focus on making a graphing application to complement, rather than replace Google Docs and Google Classroom.  This decision and two years of development got the project to where it is today.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\n\nWe owe a great debt of gratitude to \nMr. Dean Roush\n, the Physics teacher at Luck High School, for helping us test and shape the software.
