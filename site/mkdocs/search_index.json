If you don\u2019t have Yob installed already, visit our \nGoogle Doc add-on store page\n and click \u201cInstall.\u201d In order to use Yob, you must be within a Google Doc.  You can launch the program from the Add-ons toolbar under Yob and select \u201cOpen Graph Editor\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nThe Home Screen\n\n\nWhen you open the graph editor, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe home screen is organized into two sections:  the graph preview, and the main menu. The graph preview can be moved by clicking and dragging, and zoomed by scrolling the mouse wheel. The main menu contains several submenus for managing specific parts of your graph.  Let\u2019s start with the Data Set menu.\n\n\nPlotting Data\n\n\nClick \u201cData Sets\u201d from the main menu, then click the + icon to create a new Data Set. Locate the table editor at the bottom of the menu.  Here, we can enter the time-distance data from our ball experiment. Here is some sample data that we have supplied for you (you may simply copy and paste this data):\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \nTime (s)\n\n        \nDistance (cm)\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n1\n\n        \n2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n3\n\n        \n3.2\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n5\n\n        \n2.9\n\n    \n\n    \n\n        \n7\n\n        \n4.4\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nOnce entered into the table, the data can be viewed in the graph preview.\n\n\nNext, let\u2019s put proper labels on our Data Set.  We will set the xLabel field to \nTime\n and the xUnit field to \ns\n for seconds, then the yLabel field to \nDistance\n and the yUnit field to \ncm\n for centimeters.\n\n\nYour graph should now look something like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the Projected Distance\n\n\nNow that we have plotted the data, we can find the projected distance of the ball as time goes on. To accomplish this, we want to create a Curve Fit, which will calculate the line of best fit, given a Data Set and a model.\n\n\nClick \u201cBack\u201d to return to the main menu.  Then click the Curve Fits submenu, and click the + icon to create a new Curve Fit.\n\n\nSet the data source of the new Curve Fit to the Data Set we previously created:  Data Set 1. Then change the model type from none to linear. Viola! You should now see the line of best fit for this data on the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the Finishing Touches\n\n\nTo introduce a little more color on this graph, let\u2019s change the style of the Curve Fit line.  To accomplish this, click on the line preview icon near the top of the menu.  You will be presented with several styling options.  Let\u2019s change the color blue and make the line dashed, like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what\u2019s a graph without a title?  A title can be added to the graph back in the Labels submenu.  At the top of the menu, enter \u201cDistance vs Time\u201d in the Title field.\n\n\nInserting the Graph\n\n\nNow that our graph is complete, we can send it to the document. To do this, simply click \u201cInsert\u201d at the top of Yob, then select the size of the graph you want to insert. After the graph is added, you may notice that it has a link attached to it. \nDo not remove this link.\n This link is how Yob knows where the graph data is stored on your Google Drive account, so that you may edit the graph later if you wish.\n\n\nIf you wish to learn more about how Yob stores graph data, view \nthe data storage reference\n where we explain in greater detail.\n\n\nCheck Out the Other Tutorials\n\n\nYob is full of great features that are covered throughout our tutorial series.

An example would be be \nd1c1 + 2*d2c1\n, which would make each value of the column be the sum of the cooresponding value in the first column of the first Data Set and twice the cooresponding value of the first column of the second Data Set.  You can also reference Functions or Curve Fits in your expressions.  For example, \nf3(d1c1) / 10\n would make each value of the column be 1/10th of the first column of the first Data Set run through the third function.  One thing to watch out for, however, is circular dependencies.  For example, you can't have d1c1 use d2c1 in its expression if d2c1 uses d3c1 and d3c1 uses d1c1, because of the circular dependencies.
