<h1 id="usingcalculatedcolumns">Using Calculated Columns</h1>

<p>Calculated Columns are a powerful feature in Yob that allows you to generate new columns from other columns, saving you the time of manual data entry.</p>

<p>Each column of a Data Set has a calculated column menu that can be opened by clicking on the calculator icon in the top right of the column header.</p>

<p>The Calculated Column menu contains 3 items:</p>

<ol>
<li>The enabled checkbox.</li>
<li>The expression field.</li>
<li>The Data Type selector.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="theexpressionfield">The Expression Field</h3>

<p>The expression field is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>Every Calculated Column expression needs another Column within it that is not dependent on the selected Column.</p>

<h3 id="thedatatypeselector">The Data Type Selector</h3>

<p>The Data Type selector provides an more accessible way to figure out which Data Type it is that you want to use in your Calculated Column expression.</p>

<h3 id="theenabledcheckbox">The Enabled Checkbox</h3>

<p>The enabled checkbox sets whether or not the selected Column should generate (or calculate) its values from the expression.</p>

<p>Calculated Columns cells appear yellow and cannot be modified within the table editor like regular Columns can.</p>
