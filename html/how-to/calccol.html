<h1 id="usingcalculatedcolumns">Using Calculated Columns</h1>

<p>Calculated Columns are a powerful feature in Yob that allows you to use columns and modify them in any way to build a new column.</p>

<p>The Calculated Column menu can be found within an existing Data Set. It&#8217;s the calculator icon in the headers of the table editor.</p>

<p>The Calculated Column menu contains 3 items:</p>

<ol>
<li>The enabled checkbox.</li>
<li>The expression field.</li>
<li>The Data Type selector.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="theenabledcheckbox">The Enabled Checkbox</h3>

<p>The enabled checkbox sets whether or not the selected Column is a Calculated Column or not.</p>

<p>Calculated Columns cells appear yellow and cannot be modified within the table editor like regular Columns can.</p>

<h3 id="theexpressionfield">The Expression Field</h3>

<p>The expression field is where the magic happens.</p>

<p>Every Calculated Column expression needs another Column within it that is not dependent on the selected Column.</p>

<h3 id="thedatatypeselector">The Data Type Selector</h3>

<p>The Data Type selector provides an more accessible way to figure out which Data Type it is that you want to use in your Calculated Column expression.</p>
