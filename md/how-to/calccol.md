# Using Calculated Columns

Calculated Columns are a powerful feature in Yob that allows you to use columns and modify them in any way to build a new column.

The Calculated Column menu can be found within an existing Data Set. It's the calculator icon in the headers of the table editor.

The Calculated Column menu contains 3 items:

1. The enabled checkbox.
2. The expression field.
3. The Data Type selector.

### The Enabled Checkbox

The enabled checkbox sets whether or not the selected Column is a Calculated Column or not.

Calculated Columns cells appear yellow and cannot be modified within the table editor like regular Columns can.
 
### The Expression Field
 
The expression field is where the magic happens.

Every Calculated Column expression needs another Column within it that is not dependent on the selected Column.

### The Data Type Selector

The Data Type selector provides an more accessible way to figure out which Data Type it is that you want to use in your Calculated Column expression.
